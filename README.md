# What's for Tea Frontend

React-based Frontend for [What's for tea](https://github.com/Essk/whats-for-tea#readme)


* Bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/)

* Uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for css organisation and consistency (eventually)

* Data fetching is currently hardcoded to an instance of [What's for tea](https://github.com/Essk/whats-for-tea#readme) running at `http://localhost:3000`

* As this is a a toy project in early development with requirements largely undefined and no roadmap to speak of, external contributions are likely to be rejected.
